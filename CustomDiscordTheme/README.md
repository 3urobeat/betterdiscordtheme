# Better Discord Theme
To use it, clone CustomDiscordTheme.theme.css to your BetterDiscord Theme Folder. It will automatically get the newest version from GitHub.

This Better Discord Theme was made by AlexFlipnote (https://github.com/AlexFlipnote/Discord_Theme/blob/master/theme.css) and was customized by me.
